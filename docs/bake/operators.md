## Export Textures

This will show a popup that allows you to bake the active material to PBR maps.

When exporting textures, a cache folder will be created to store the baked maps. We recommend having each Blender project in it's own folder to avoid overwritting any images that may already exist with the same name.

## Bake High Poly

This will show a popup that allows you to bake details from a high poly mesh to a normal map.
