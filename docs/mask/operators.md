## Bake All

This will bake all the masks on the current layer. Once clicked there will be a popup that allows you to replace all the current masks on the layer with the mask after baking. This is helpful when using generator masks that are computationally expensive.

## Hide Masks

This will hide all the masks on the active layer.

## Reset

This will delete all the masks on the active layer.

## Add Mask

This will allow you to add a mask to the mask stack.
