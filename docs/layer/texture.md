# Layer Settings - Texture Layer

Texture layers use a single texture to drive the other channels. The layer type allows for the use of an image or an internal Blender texture node.

The main texture is driven by the albedo channel. This workflow is especially handy for users who have a single texture and want to create the other channels using this texture.

In the example below, a painted metal image was used to generate the maps for the other channels.
