### Blank Layer

The blank layer operator will delete all the nodes on the selected layer and allow the user to create their own nodes inside the layer group in the node editor.

Click **[HERE](./user.md)** to learn more about blank layers.

### Material Library

This will allow you to automatically load materials from libraries saved in the addon preferences.

If you set up previews for these materials you will also be able to view the previews here.

### PBR Setup

This will allow you to navigate to a directory and select the maps that you would like to import for the different channels.

### Texture Import

This will allow you to import a texture that will then be used as the main texture in a texture setup layer.

### Texture Setup

This will setup nodes to use a main texture (image or procedural) to drive the albedo channel and colorramp nodes to create maps for the other channels.

### Reset

This will delete all the nodes on the active layer and create Value and RGB nodes for the different channels.
