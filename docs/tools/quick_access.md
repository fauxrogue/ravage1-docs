# Panels

Ravage comes with a variety of popup panels that make the texturing process that much less of a burden. These panels can be accessed using the set **[hotkeys.](tool_hotkeys.md)**

## Lighting Panel (Shift + Alt + Q)

The lighting panel makes it easy to quickly access lighting properties and adjust them on the fly.

The lighting panel also contains operators that set the lighting whether EEVEE or Cycles to optimal texturing conditions.
